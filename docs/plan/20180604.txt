Crucial Jobs:
- logic checking, regarding bouncing angle calculations


Core Functionality Components:
- obstacles
     - Kickers
     - Ramps
     - Bumpers
     - Wall
        - reflection seem a little queer, need checking
     - inContact() for most of them, and the bumping mechanism 
- flippers
   - inContact and bumping:
     - whether it is possible to make the ball not fall through the flippers
     - ball may sometimes not be able to fall through the flippers
   - make fipper movement consistent such that key presses will have the same effect on the flippers rather than seemingly random angles
     - each key press need to wait a period until the flipper stays constantly at the top
   
- user interface
   

Non-Essential Components:
- point system
- special effects
- design field of the game
- regulation of user interface



Hiearchy of PreRequisition(???):
1) put everything necessary into the picture for basic level of game
     a)ball, obstacles, flippers
     b) verify and test inContact(Ball) mechanism and bumping mechanism for each
        i) flippers
        ii) wall
        iii) other obstacles
     c)Game(creation, etc), to be revised accordingly with each class
2) contact of ball with obstacle/flipper/wall, and bumping of ball with such contact
3) improve functionality
4) design of game and decorations


Tasks to be Delegated:


Tasks to be Tackled Collaboratively:
- need to work out a consistent inContact and reflection formula
